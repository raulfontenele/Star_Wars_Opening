                    <h2>A NEW HOPE</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is a period of civil war.
                        Rebel spaceships, striking
                        from a hidden base, have won
                        their first victory against
                        the evil Galactic Empire.
                        <br>
                        During the battle, Rebel
                        spies managed to steal secret
                        plans to the Empire's
                        ultimate weapon, the DEATH
                        STAR, an armored space
                        station with enough power to
                        destroy an entire planet.
                        <br>
                        Pursued by the Empire's
                        sinister agents, Princess
                        Leia races home aboard her
                        starship, custodian of the
                        stolen plans that can save
                        her people and restore
                        freedom to the galaxy.....
